/**
 * Q2: Prime numbers (10 pts)
 * 
 * Write a Java program that prints out all prime numbers between 
 * two integer inputs `a` and `b` (without the quotes), inclusive.
 * 
 * 
 * Notes:
 *    This problem asks you to write a complex program.
 * 
 *    Don't panic! 
 * 
 *    The key to solving complex programming problem is to break the problem
 *    into subproblems that are easier to manage. Solve the easier subproblems, 
 *    combine them to solve the original, complex problem.
 * 
 *    I suggest breaking down this problem into two components:
 *      i)    Prompting the user for input and checking if the input is correct (see instructions).
 *      ii)   Checking whether a given positive integer is prime.
 * 
 *      After this, you can expand the program to test whether other numbers are prime
 *      using a loop.
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1) The inputs a and b (defined in the main method for your convenience) should be provided by the user.
 *    You may use any methods from the Scanner class to help you do so. 
 * 
 *    The inputs a and b should be i) integers, ii) strictly positive (>= 1) and iii) the input b should be greater or equal than a. 
 *      - You may assume the input will always be entered as integers. You do NOT need to check this.
 *      - However, you MUST check whether the inputs are strictly positive and whether b >= a.
 *        If the inputs are incorrect, your program should print "Incorrect input!" and stop. 
 * 
 * 
 * 2) An integer greater than 1 is prime if its only positive divisor is 1 or itself.
 *    For example, the numbers 2,3,5,7 are all prime numbers, but 4,6,8, and 9 are not.
 *    To determine whether a number is prime, check whether it is divisible by every number between 2 and number/2.
 * 
 * 
 * 3) Your code should print out all prime numbers between the integer inputs a and b, inclusive.
 *    The formatting of the output is not important; you'll get full marks as long as the input is checked
 *    for correctness and all the correct prime numbers are printed.
